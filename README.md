# A Documented Case of Managerial Retaliation & HR Failure

## Disclaimer

This repository documents a chronological timeline of events experienced by a former employee of GitHub, Inc. (a Microsoft subsidiary). It is presented as a neutral, evidence-based case study for examination by professionals in technology, human resources, and corporate governance. All information is sourced from contemporaneous records and is presented as-is. Documentation has been redacted to protect personal privacy. Information regarding other individuals is limited to what is publicly available on professional networking profiles.

## Executive Summary

This case involves a Project Manager ('PM'), hired on March 19, 2024, whose role was dissolved days later, initiating a documented pattern of managerial instability, disability discrimination, and procedural failures. The situation culminated in the PM's termination just two business days after commencing approved FMLA leave.

The following timeline is supported by primary source evidence. Each chapter provides documented examples of systemic patterns, highlighting the breakdown of protective policies and the consequences for those they are designed to shield.

## Timeline of Key Events & Evidence

### [Chapter 1: ‚ö†Ô∏è Role Dissolution & Failure to Onboard - Excellence Delivered Nonetheless‚ú®](https://github.com/denydelaydefend/github-microsoft-hr-failure-case-study-2025/issues/1)
*   **Date:** March 22, 2024
*   **Issue:** Employee's role was dissolved three days after start date. No new job description, training, or defined success metrics were provided, setting them up for failure. Despite the active detriment and neglect, PM scales insurmountable odds and performs with customized execution and is recognized and honored for skill and demanor.
*   **Exhibit A:**  
    *   <b>Impact:</b> Evidence of instability from Day 1. Evidence of performance: Peer reviews, DIR reviews (up until formal negative feedback), Sparkle Recognition, Received Awards & Nominations
      
### [Chapter 2: üî¶ Pattern of Managerial Neglect & Inconsistent Communication](https://github.com/denydelaydefend/github-microsoft-hr-failure-case-study-2025/issues/2)
*   **Dates:** March 2024 - February 2025
*   **Issue:** Direct manager consistently canceled 1:1s, provided contradictory instructions, and failed to provide timely feedback, creating operational chaos.
*   **Exhibit B:**
    *    <b>Impact:</b>  A multi-page PDF of a canceled 1:1, one of a delayed (>24hr) Slack response to a critical question, and one of contradictory instructions. This shows a pattern, not a one-off.

### Chapter 3: üö® Retaliatory Feedback Meeting & Disability Disclosure Weaponization
*   **Date:** February 7, 2025
*   **Issue:** Manager initiated a confrontational meeting to critique months-old feedback, making a derogatory comment about the employee's documented disability both live in a video call and then again as a catalyst in a group Slack thread. 
*   **Exhibit C:** 
    *    <b>Impact:</b>  Derogative gaslighting and laying groundwork for HR complaint with broken trust and blatant manipulation. 

###  Chapter 4: ‚õî Directed Harassment and Weaponization of Disability
*   **Date:** February 10, 2025
*   **Issue:** Manager [DIR], aware of employee's disability and seizure risk, encouraged a colleague via Slack to take actions to "make [PM] spiral."
*   **Exhibit D:** 
    *   **Impact:** üí®üî´ A direct, unedited screenshot of the Slack message showing undeniable and viscerally damning proof of DIR performing active work and manipulation against PM.  

###  Chapter 5: üì© Formal HR Complaint and HR's Failure to Act
*   **Date:** February 20, 2025
*   **Issue:** Employee filed a formal "Workplace Conduct & Leadership Impact Report" (HR Case #47914) detailing retaliation and harassment. HR acknowledged but took no protective action, leaving the employee under the authority of the manager they reported. HR continued in a dismissive pattern at Github and at Microsoft where PM submitted multiple reports and issues of concern. 
*   **Exhibit E:**
    *   **Impact:** An image of the HR ticket confirmation for both Github and Microsoft submissions, proving both Github and Microsoft were officially on notice.

###  Chapter 6:‚ùó Approved FMLA Leave Followed by Immediate Termination ‚ùå
#### *   **Dates:** Approved FMLA leave began on May 9, 2025 | Terminated May 13, 2025
*   **Issue:** Employee was terminated via email for "role elimination" just two business days after commencing approved, protected medical leave and with an active HR investigation against the authority figure who submitted PM's name for termination. Documentation verifies that DIR gave PM a '65' FAILING score on latest annual review. 
*   **Exhibit F:**
    *   **Impact:** A single PDF with three pages. Page 1: The FMLA approval notice. Page 2: The termination email. Page 3: HR's email showing they closed the investigation on July 11th, 2025 - post termination and during active FMLA.  The proximity is undeniable, the road of retaliation clearly defined. 

###  Chapter 7: ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Post-Termination Bad Faith & Financial Harm üí∏
*   **Dates:** May - October 2025
*   **Issue:** The company refused to reimburse business expenses on a corporate card tied to the employee's SSN, causing personal liability, delinquency fees, and credit damage. The company also refused to compensate for time spent on company business - post termination, for the reason that "the employee was terminated". 
*   **Exhibit G:** 
    *   **Impact:** A PDF with a timeline of emails begging for reimbursement, showing the runaround from both GitHub and Microsoft finance. This demonstrates the callousness extends beyond HR. Additionally emails showing the request to review the results of the investigation with HR detailing coporate manuvering and cyclical bad faith.

## Conclusion ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üì¢‚ùóüö®
#### This repository illustrates a failure of managerial conduct, HR safeguards, and corporate accountability. It is published as a cautionary tale and a case study for the industry - these corporations do not care about your humanity and their systems are a front - they will use you, abuse you and then gaslight you saying it wasn't so. I know there's been a myriad of wreckage with Github's layoff non-policy/procedure (no coherent thought given, names submitted by leadership based on who gave them warm fuzzies to stay and those who they didn't like to be fired). Detailed in these issues is about 10% of the story - as the saying goes, there are always three versions: yours, mine and the truth. Moreover, 10% is also the amount of documentation shared versus what exists and is available as the situation so permits.
