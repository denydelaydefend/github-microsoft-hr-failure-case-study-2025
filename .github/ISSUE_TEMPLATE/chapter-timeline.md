## February  2024: Via Github Recruiter - 

#### A request for a formal Job Description, as the role I applied for initially I was declined in favor for an internal candidate, however I was offered this backfill by way of recognition of talents and value and entry into the organization.

## September  2024: Via Github Legacy Repos - 
#### A result of an on-going search for resources and direction, PM finds a legacy Job Description for a PM for the first two days they worked and the organization was structured differently. Without specified or supplied formalized direction, PM basis continued autonomous work on this structural framework with a mentality for a need for variance as observed. These skills, experiences and outcomes also become the foundation for formal Reflections to refute a given FAILING score of 65 - as this was the documented JD in the departmental offering.

## October  2024: Via Github Formal Reflections -

## February  2025: Via direct engagement with DIR -
#### DIR uses cornerstone of trajectory for PM, their start date of 3/19/24 and their role being dissolved and never re-defined on 3/21/24, as an attempt in a typical monologue to demean, manipulate and evoke an emotional response from PM; the first point of Retaliation.

## October  2025: Via Github Career center - 
#### Despite the original requisition number and offer letter being available, the signed job description or offering is not - none known shared.

# üèÖ üí∞ Feedback, Awards, Recognition

#### This section presents a quantifiable disconnect between documented performance and the eventual 'failing' designation. The consistent history of awards, accolades, and direct managerial praise establishes a clear baseline of high performance and value contribution. The subsequent, abrupt shift to a termination-worthy score of 65, following protected activities, raises critical questions about the validity of that assessment and suggests it was a pretextual tool for retaliation. The score reflects not a sudden collapse in competence, but a documented collapse in organizational integrity‚Äîillustrating a systemic pattern familiar to many in similar environments
