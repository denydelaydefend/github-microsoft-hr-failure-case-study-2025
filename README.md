# A Documented Case of Managerial Retaliation & HR Failure

## Disclaimer
This repository presents a chronological timeline of events documented by a former employee of GitHub, Inc. (a Microsoft subsidiary). The purpose is to serve as a neutral, evidence-based case study for professionals in tech, HR, and corporate governance. All information is presented as-is from contemporaneous records.

## Executive Summary
This case involves a Project Manager (going forward to be referred to as 'PM') who was hired on March 19, 2024, had their role dissolved days later, and was subsequently subjected to a documented pattern of managerial (the direct manager was a Director in the department and going forward to be referred to as 'DIR') retaliation, disability discrimination, and HR neglect, culminating in termination four days into approved FMLA leave.

The following timeline is supported by primary source evidence.

## Timeline of Key Events & Evidence

### 1.  [Chapter 1: ‚ö†Ô∏è Role Dissolution & Failure to Onboard - Excellence Delivered Nonetheless‚ú®](https://github.com/denydelaydefend/github-microsoft-hr-failure-case-study-2025/issues/1)
*   **Date:** March 22, 2024
*   **Issue:** Employee's role was dissolved three days after start date. No new job description, training, or defined success metrics were provided, setting them up for failure. Despite the active detriment and neglect, PM scales insurmountable odds and performs with customized execution and is recognized and honored for skill and demanor.
*   **Exhibit A:**  
    *   <b>Impact:</b> Evidence of instability from Day 1. Evidence of performance: Peer reviews, DIR reviews (up until formal negative feedback), Sparkle Recognition, Received Awards & Nominations
      
### 2.[Chapter 2: üî¶ Pattern of Managerial Neglect & Inconsistent Communication](https://github.com/denydelaydefend/github-microsoft-hr-failure-case-study-2025/issues/2)
*   **Dates:** March 2024 - February 2025
*   **Issue:** Direct manager consistently canceled 1:1s, provided contradictory instructions, and failed to provide timely feedback, creating operational chaos.
*   **Exhibit B:**
    *    <b>Impact:</b>  A multi-page PDF of a canceled 1:1, one of a delayed (>24hr) Slack response to a critical question, and one of contradictory instructions. This shows a pattern, not a one-off.

### 3.üö® Retaliatory Feedback Meeting & Disability Disclosure Weaponization
*   **Date:** February 7, 2025
*   **Issue:** Manager initiated a confrontational meeting to critique months-old feedback, making a derogatory comment about the employee's documented disability.
*   **Exhibit C:** 
    *    <b>Impact:</b>  Derogative gaslighting and laying groundwork for HR complaint with broken trust and blatant manipulation. 

### 4.‚õî Directed Harassment and Weaponization of Disability
*   **Date:** February 10, 2025
*   **Issue:** Manager, aware of employee's disability and seizure risk, encouraged a colleague via Slack to take actions to "make [Employee] spiral."
*   **Exhibit D:** 
    *   **Impact:** This is the "smoking gun." A direct, unedited screenshot of the Slack message showing undeniable and viscerally damning proof. 

### 5. üì© Formal HR Complaint and HR's Failure to Act
*   **Date:** February 12, 2025
*   **Issue:** Employee filed a formal "Workplace Conduct & Leadership Impact Report" (HR Case #47914) detailing retaliation and harassment. HR acknowledged but took no protective action, leaving the employee under the authority of the manager they reported.
*   **Exhibit E:**
    *   **Impact:** A screenshot of the HR ticket confirmation email proving both Github and Microsoft were officially on notice.

### 6.‚ùó Approved FMLA Leave Followed by Immediate Termination ‚ùå
*   **Dates:** FMLA Approved May 9, 2025 | Terminated May 13, 2025
*   **Issue:** Employee was terminated via email for "role elimination" just four business days after commencing approved, protected medical leave.
*   **Exhibit F:**
    *   **Impact:** A single PDF with two pages. Page 1: The FMLA approval notice. Page 2: The termination email. The proximity is undeniable, the road of retaliation clearly defined. 

### 7.‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Post-Termination Bad Faith & Financial Harm üí∏
*   **Dates:** May - July 2025
*   **Issue:** The company refused to reimburse business expenses on a corporate card tied to the employee's SSN, causing personal liability, delinquency fees, and credit damage.
*   **Exhibit G:** 
    *   **Impact:** A PDF with a timeline of emails begging for reimbursement, showing the runaround from both GitHub and Microsoft finance. This demonstrates the callousness extends beyond HR.

## Conclusion ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üì¢‚ùóüö®
This repository illustrates a failure of managerial conduct, HR safeguards, and corporate accountability. It is published as a cautionary tale and a case study for the industry - these corporations do not care about your humanity and their systems are a front - they will use you, abuse you and then gaslight you saing it wasn't so. I know there's been a myria of wreckage with Github's layoff non-policy/procedure (no coherent thought given, names submitted by leadership based on who gave them warm fuzzies to stay and those who they didn't like to be fired).
