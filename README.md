# A Documented Case of Managerial Retaliation & HR Failure

## Disclaimer
This repository presents a chronological timeline of events documented by a former employee of GitHub, Inc. (a Microsoft subsidiary). The purpose is to serve as a neutral, evidence-based case study for professionals in tech, HR, and corporate governance. All information is presented as-is from contemporaneous records.

## Executive Summary
This case involves a Project Manager who was hired on March 19, 2024, had their role dissolved days later, and was subsequently subjected to a documented pattern of managerial retaliation, disability discrimination, and HR neglect, culminating in termination four days into approved FMLA leave. The following timeline is supported by primary source evidence.

## Timeline of Key Events & Evidence

### 1. ⚠️ Role Dissolution & Failure to Onboard
*   **Date:** March 22, 2024
*   **Issue:** Employee's role was dissolved three days after start date. No new job description, training, or defined success metrics were provided, setting them up for failure.
*   **Exhibit A:** 
    *   **Impact Note:** A clear screenshot of the email or Slack message announcing the reorganization and the lack of a defined new role is most impactful. It demonstrates the instability from day one.

### 2.🔦 Pattern of Managerial Neglect & Inconsistent Communication
*   **Dates:** March 2024 - February 2025
*   **Issue:** Direct manager consistently canceled 1:1s, provided contradictory instructions, and failed to provide timely feedback, creating operational chaos.
*   **Exhibit B:** 
    *   **Impact Note:** A multi-page PDF is best here. Combine 2-3 screenshots: one of a canceled 1:1, one of a delayed (>24hr) Slack response to a critical question, and one of contradictory instructions. This shows a pattern, not a one-off.

### 3.🚨 Retaliatory Feedback Meeting & Disability Disclosure Weaponization
*   **Date:** February 7, 2025
*   **Issue:** Manager initiated a confrontational meeting to critique months-old feedback, making a derogatory comment about the employee's documented disability.
*   **Exhibit C:** 
    *   **Impact Note:** A transcribed log of the meeting is more powerful than a summary. Format it as a script. If you have a recording, a *transcript* is the most impactful. Clearly notate the derogatory comment.

### 4.⛔ Directed Harassment and Weaponization of Disability
*   **Date:** February 10, 2025
*   **Issue:** Manager, aware of employee's disability and seizure risk, encouraged a colleague via Slack to take actions to "make [Employee] spiral."
*   **Exhibit D:** 
    *   **Impact Note:** This is your "smoking gun." A direct, unedited screenshot of the Slack message is non-negotiable. It is undeniable and viscerally damning.

### 5. 📩 Formal HR Complaint and HR's Failure to Act
*   **Date:** February 12, 2025
*   **Issue:** Employee filed a formal "Workplace Conduct & Leadership Impact Report" (HR Case #47914) detailing retaliation and harassment. HR acknowledged but took no protective action, leaving the employee under the authority of the manager they reported.
*   **Exhibit E:**
    *   **Impact Note:** A screenshot of the HR ticket confirmation email is crucial. It proves the company was officially on notice.

### 6.❗ Approved FMLA Leave Followed by Immediate Termination ❌
*   **Dates:** FMLA Approved May 9, 2025 | Terminated May 13, 2025
*   **Issue:** Employee was terminated via email for "role elimination" just four business days after commencing approved, protected medical leave.
*   **Exhibit F:**
    *   **Impact Note:** Create a single PDF with two pages. Page 1: The FMLA approval notice. Page 2: The termination email. The proximity is the entire argument. The visual side-by-side (or one-after-the-other) is devastating.

### 7.⛓️‍💥 Post-Termination Bad Faith & Financial Harm 💸
*   **Dates:** May - July 2025
*   **Issue:** The company refused to reimburse business expenses on a corporate card tied to the employee's SSN, causing personal liability, delinquency fees, and credit damage.
*   **Exhibit G:** `corporate-card-fraud.pdf`
    *   **Impact Note:** A PDF with a timeline of emails begging for reimbursement, showing the runaround from both GitHub and Microsoft finance. This demonstrates the callousness extends beyond HR.

## Conclusion 🤦🏼‍♀️ 📢❗🚨
This repository illustrates a failure of managerial conduct, HR safeguards, and corporate accountability. It is published as a cautionary tale and a case study for the industry - these corporations do not care about your humanity and their systems are a front - they will use you, abuse you and then gaslight you saing it wasn't so. I know there's been a myria of wreckage with Github's layoff non-policy/procedure (no coherent thought given, names submitted by leadership based on who gave them warm fuzzies to stay and those who they didn't like to be fired).
